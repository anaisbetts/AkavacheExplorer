This application is a developer utility for
[Akavache](http://github.com/github/akavache) that allows you to dig around in
the contents of the Akavache cache visually in different formats. Akavache
Explorer guarantees that it won't write to the cache and ignores TTL, so it is
useful for examining your app's cache without worrying that it will be
changed.
